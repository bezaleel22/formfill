# Implementation Plan: AutoFill - AI-Driven Form Automation with Hono

**Project Goal:** Automate the submission of student registration data to the BEMIS portal by extracting data from handwritten form images using AI and submitting it programmatically. The project, named "AutoFill," uses Hono on Bun.js for the backend and features a SaaS-style landing page with an embedded interactive application.

**Evolution of the Plan:**
The project initially aimed at a CLI script. It then evolved to a web API, with the backend framework ultimately being Hono on the Bun.js runtime, focusing on an AI-driven approach to extract data directly from images. Subsequent phases focused on UI/UX enhancements, including a full landing page and a refined in-app experience.

## Phase 1: Foundational BEMIS Interaction (CLI - Core Logic)

- **Status:** âœ… Completed and adapted.
- **Objective:** Establish basic programmatic communication with BEMIS, handling authentication and CSRF.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **Project Setup (Bun.js):** Initialized project, basic structure.
  2.  **Session Cookie & XSRF-TOKEN Handling (`src/authUtils.ts`):** Implemented reading `session.txt` and extracting the XSRF token.
  3.  **CSRF Form Field Token Fetching (`src/csrfUtils.ts`):** Implemented logic to GET the BEMIS student creation modal and parse the `__RequestVerificationToken`.
  4.  **Form Data Preparation (`src/formDataUtils.ts`):** Created utilities to build the `URLSearchParams` payload, ensuring all BEMIS fields are present.
  5.  **Core BEMIS POST Submission Logic:** Developed the function to send the POST request with correct headers and payload.
  6.  **Response Handling & Logging:** Basic mechanisms to interpret BEMIS responses.
  7.  **Initial Documentation (`README.md`):** Basic usage instructions.

## Phase 2: Transition to Web API (Hono on Bun.js) & AI Integration

- **Status:** âœ… Completed.
- **Objective:** Create a web API using Hono on Bun.js to receive image uploads, integrate with an AI service for data extraction, and use the Phase 1 BEMIS logic for submission.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **Backend Framework Implementation (Hono on Bun.js):**
      - Set up Hono application in `src/index.ts`.
      - Implemented `POST /api/submit-student` and `POST /api/extract-form-data` endpoints.
      - Configured to handle `multipart/form-data` using `await c.req.formData()`.
      - Set up static file serving for `public/` directory using `serveStatic` from `hono/bun`.
      - Added Hono middleware (e.g., `logger`, `secureHeaders`).
  2.  **AI Extraction Service (`src/aiExtractionService.ts`):**
      - Integrated with OpenRouter API to use user-selectable models (e.g., Qwen).
      - Developed image-to-DataURI conversion (and later, Buffer conversion from `File` object).
      - **Extensive Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively refined the prompt to accurately extract and format data.
  3.  **API Key Handling (`src/apiKeyService.ts` & UI Integration):** Implemented backend service for `api_keys.json` and frontend UI for users to add/manage their OpenRouter keys.
  4.  **BEMIS Session Cookie Handling (Backend & UI):** Implemented backend logic to store/retrieve session cookie from `session.txt` and frontend UI for users to input their cookie. Added `/api/settings/session-cookie` endpoint.
  5.  **Service Orchestration (`src/index.ts`):** API endpoints call relevant services.
  6.  **Refactor BEMIS Logic (`src/bemisService.ts`):** Ensured BEMIS interaction logic was well-encapsulated.
  7.  **Initial Frontend Development (`public/` directory with Tailwind CSS):**
      - Created `index.html` for image upload, settings (API key, School ID, AI Model, Session Cookie).
      - Developed `app.js` for client-side logic: image preview, `fetch` API calls, and displaying results.

## Phase 3: Iterative Refinement, UI Enhancements, and BEMIS Quirks

- **Status:** âœ… Completed.
- **Objective:** Stabilize the end-to-end flow, address BEMIS-specific challenges, improve AI accuracy, and enhance user interface and experience.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **BEMIS Error Handling & Success Response:** Improved interpretation of BEMIS responses (e.g., `204 No Content`).
  2.  **AI Prompt Iteration (Continuous):** Addressed specific formatting requirements.
  3.  **Payload Completeness & CSRF Robustness:** Ensured correct implementation.
  4.  **Frontend Enhancements:**
      - **Automatic AI Extraction:** Triggered on image upload/capture.
      - **Tabbed Interface:** Replaced sidebar with "AI Extract" and "Settings & Model" tabs.
      - **Refined Settings Layout:** Implemented two-column grid and auto-width buttons in settings tab.
      - **Camera Integration:** Added full-screen camera modal for image capture.
      - **Inline Name Review:** Streamlined the data review process post-extraction.
      - Improved display of data, results, and error messages.
  5.  **Hono Form Data Processing:** Adapted to handle `File` objects and convert to `Buffer`.

## Phase 4: UI/UX Overhaul & Landing Page Integration

- **Status:** âœ… Completed.
- **Objective:** Transform the application into a SaaS-style landing page ("AutoFill") with an embedded, interactive app, enhancing user experience and visual appeal.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **Landing Page Design & Structure (`public/index.html`):**
      - Created Hero, Features, and Footer sections.
      - Implemented sticky navigation header.
  2.  **Dynamic Background & Animations (CSS):**
      - Added CSS grid background with glowing radial gradients.
      - Implemented subtle animated "artifact" elements.
  3.  **App Embedding & Styling:**
      - Integrated the existing application into a dedicated `#the-app-section`.
      - Styled the app section with a semi-transparent, blurred background to distinguish it.
  4.  **Landing Page Interactivity (`public/app.js`):**
      - Implemented smooth scrolling for "Get Started Now" / "Use App" buttons.
      - Added Intersection Observer for fade-in animations on landing page sections.
  5.  **Preservation of App Functionality:** Ensured all previous app features (tabs, forms, AI extraction, BEMIS submission, camera) remained fully functional within the new landing page structure.

## Phase 5: Documentation

- **Status:** ðŸ”„ Ongoing (reflecting latest changes).
- **Objective:** Document the final system architecture, implementation details, and usage.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **`docs/implementation_details.md`:** Updated to accurately describe components, flow, and new UI/UX features.
  2.  **`docs/architecture.md`:** Updated to reflect the landing page architecture and embedded app structure.
  3.  **`docs/implementation_plan.md` (This Document):** Updated to reflect the actual development path and new phases.
  4.  **`README.md`:** To be reviewed and updated with final setup and usage instructions.
