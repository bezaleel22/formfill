# Implementation Plan: Student Form Submission Automation (AI-Driven with Hono)

**Project Goal:** Automate the submission of student registration data to the BEMIS portal by extracting data from handwritten form images using AI and submitting it programmatically, using Hono on Bun.js for the backend.

**Evolution of the Plan:**
The project initially aimed at a CLI script. It then evolved to a web API, with the backend framework ultimately being Hono on the Bun.js runtime, focusing on an AI-driven approach to extract data directly from images.

## Phase 1: Foundational BEMIS Interaction (CLI - Core Logic)

- **Status:** ✅ Completed and adapted.
- **Objective:** Establish basic programmatic communication with BEMIS, handling authentication and CSRF.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **Project Setup (Bun.js):** Initialized project, basic structure. (STAUTO-001)
  2.  **Session Cookie & XSRF-TOKEN Handling (`src/authUtils.ts`):** Implemented reading `session.txt` and extracting the XSRF token. (STAUTO-002)
  3.  **CSRF Form Field Token Fetching (`src/csrfUtils.ts`):** Implemented logic to GET the BEMIS student creation modal and parse the `__RequestVerificationToken`. (STAUTO-003)
  4.  **Form Data Preparation (`src/formDataUtils.ts`):** Created utilities to build the `URLSearchParams` payload, ensuring all BEMIS fields are present. (STAUTO-004)
  5.  **Core BEMIS POST Submission Logic:** Developed the function to send the POST request with correct headers and payload. (STAUTO-005)
  6.  **Response Handling & Logging:** Basic mechanisms to interpret BEMIS responses. (STAUTO-006)
  7.  **Initial Documentation (`README.md`):** Basic usage instructions. (STAUTO-008)

## Phase 2: Transition to Web API (Hono on Bun.js) & AI Integration

- **Status:** ✅ Completed.
- **Objective:** Create a web API using Hono on Bun.js to receive image uploads, integrate with an AI service for data extraction, and use the Phase 1 BEMIS logic for submission.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **Backend Framework Implementation (Hono on Bun.js):**
      - Set up Hono application in `src/index.ts`.
      - Implemented `POST /api/submit-student` endpoint.
      - Configured to handle `multipart/form-data` using `await c.req.formData()`.
      - Set up static file serving for `public/` directory using `serveStatic` from `hono/bun`.
      - Added Hono middleware (e.g., `logger`, `secureHeaders`).
  2.  **AI Extraction Service (`src/aiExtractionService.ts`):**
      - Integrated with OpenRouter API to use the Qwen `qwen-vl-max` model.
      - Developed image-to-DataURI conversion (and later, Buffer conversion from `File` object).
      - **Extensive Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively refined the prompt to accurately extract and format data according to `StudentData` interface and BEMIS requirements. This was a major iterative effort.
  3.  **API Key Handling (`src/apiKeyService.ts` - conceptual):** Placeholder for API key management; currently, key is passed from client.
  4.  **Service Orchestration (`src/index.ts`):** The API endpoint now calls `aiExtractionService` then `bemisService`.
  5.  **Refactor BEMIS Logic (`src/bemisService.ts`):** Ensured BEMIS interaction logic from Phase 1 was well-encapsulated.
  6.  **Frontend Development (`public/` directory):**
      - Created `index.html` for image upload, API key input, and School ID.
      - Developed `app.js` for client-side logic: image preview, `fetch` API calls to the backend, and displaying results/errors.

## Phase 3: Iterative Refinement, Debugging, and BEMIS Quirks

- **Status:** ✅ Completed.
- **Objective:** Stabilize the end-to-end flow, address BEMIS-specific challenges, and improve AI accuracy.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **BEMIS Error Handling Improvement:**
      - Modified `bemisService.ts` to set `Accept: application/json` header.
  2.  **Handling BEMIS `204 No Content`:** Updated `bemisService.ts` to correctly interpret HTTP 204 as a successful submission.
  3.  **AI Prompt Iteration (Continuous):** Addressed numerous specific formatting requirements (field names, date formats, uppercasing, etc.).
  4.  **Payload Completeness (`formDataUtils.ts`):** Ensured `ALL_STUDENT_DATA_KEYS` are used.
  5.  **CSRF Token Robustness:** Ensured correct implementation.
  6.  **Frontend Enhancements:** Improved display of data and results.
  7.  **Hono Form Data Processing:** Adapted to handle `File` objects from `c.req.formData()` and convert to `Buffer` for `aiExtractionService`.

## Phase 4: Documentation

- **Status:** ✅ Completed.
- **Objective:** Document the final system architecture, implementation details, and usage, reflecting the Hono on Bun.js stack.
- **Key Tasks & Outcomes:**
  1.  **`docs/implementation_details.md`:** Updated to accurately describe components and flow with Hono/Bun.
  2.  **`docs/architecture.md`:** Updated to reflect the final Hono/Bun and AI-driven architecture.
  3.  **`docs/implementation_plan.md` (This Document):** Updated to reflect the actual development path with Hono/Bun.
  4.  **`README.md`:** Updated with instructions for setting up and running the Hono/Bun application.
